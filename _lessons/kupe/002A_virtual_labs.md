Kupe provides persistent Virtual Lab services. These are provided from virtual machines executing on the CS500 nodes, each of which is a 40 core, 2.4GHz Skylake processor, with 768GB of memory, a native Spectrum Scale (GPFS) client, and EDR (Infiniband) connectivity to storage.

The following Virtual Labs are available to authorised NIWA users.
